            <p><strong>my name probably triggers another meera in your mind</strong> because unlike my sister, my parents gave me one of the most common annoying indian names out there. i'm known for my weirdness. i have many pet peeves, but not normal ones. i cannot watch people brush their teeth. foamy stuff makes me want to gag yet i'm an expert at grinding my teeth at night. i am one of the most pickiest eaters. vegetarian. no onions/garlic/eggs/gelatin because i'm not allowed to. by choice, no cream cheese, parmesan cheese, kraft singles sliced cheese, rotli's, or chinese food. falafals might be my favorite. family is a priority in life even if me and vruti fight more than MMA fighters. grandparents rule. my dad has the worst anger management problem but is the most talented person ever. he is one of the best singers i know. mom is the best cook. dada is the funniest man in the universe. ba is the cutest waddling penguin. cousins = awesome. i love giving shoutouts. i love people, majority of the population does NOT annoy me. drugs suck mainly cause i cant swallow pills yet. i'm in a pharmacy program. i always used to wear the same ring until it died in April 2011. i love my nails. i prefer experiencing over listening. i laugh at a lot of things becausec as sejal states, i am easily entertained. cookies and cream is the best flavor in sweets and raspberry lemonade in candies and drinks. blistex raspberry lemonade chap stick has taken over a few souls. nutella is orgasmic. in all ends, i gave up chocolate. after 5 months, i gave up giving up chocolate. when i don't feel like talking, music speaks for me. i DO love loud music. and i can fall alseep in any moving vehicle within seconds. i have fun making fun of people but i know my consequences. my childhood was beyond amazing. friends are priceless. 1337 has turned into a home, not just for me, but for all and my housemates into my sisters. robots sound cool but i prefer not to live in a technological world - fancy gadgets truly bother me. i prefer playing nintendo 64 over the wii. the word infinity boggles my mind, i love it so much that i would like that to be my first car but remember, be careful what you wish for. i always replay the rugrats episode when angelica turned into a statue when i hear this line. the 90's shows are by far the best. but now, i watch the least tv ever. maybe because my dad took American channels away from us during our prime years. however, movies do steal my attention. they may be a waste of money but i love theaters. i have way too many clothes and i love to buy more but i wouldn't call me spoiled. i like to work to make myself feel less guilty. i believe in ghosts. if i won the lottery, i'd split it between school, parents, and AKSHARDHAM. that's because i love maharaj, swami, mandir. unfortunately, i'm not gonna win the lottery. peanut butter m&m's used to be delicious when i could eat them. paris is pretty. i hate to procrastinate but i do it all the time. spring tops every other season. i won a cursive handwriting contest in 3rd grade and now it sucks. i guess my print's quite neat. i am the #1 split end splitter. if you get bored/annoyed of me, play with my hair; i assure you i will be fast asleep within seconds. i can walk on my hands. the world upside down is perplexing. alice in wonderland. college has taught me a lot about life. a remote to control life WOULD be great, but again i do not prefer a technological world. traveling is a stressful relief. i get excited when i find a tal on my skin. i have two natural hickies (i never learned how to spell it) - one on my neck and one on my thigh, yes very seductive. i enjoy singing along to music. motivational words are needed in life. my sister loves the word phenomenal. ice cubes were the best thing invented. 9 is my favorite number for no reason, it just sounds cool. do not have a favorite color but i think some colors have some cool names - periwinkle, tickle-me-pink, midnight blue, indian red, razzmatazz. i think art is beautiful. spam mail is SO annoying. k3g is a great movie. i have yet to find my 4 leaf clover. if you get bored/annoyed of me again, this time put me in a moving vehicle. i assure you once again, i will be fast asleep within seconds.one of my nicknames is Mia Fooskey. i fear white hairs, the black hole, and tampons. there were days i was obsessed with taz mania. i have a huge stuffed animal collection that i will never get rid of, each one of them has a place in my heart. centipedes need to lose some legs. any sharp object near a wrist makes me want to faint. i faint in showers like its my job. i do not prefer crying. but i do get emotional. the moon is prettier than the sun but sunsets and sunrises are gorgeous. little kids are almost as entertaining as my dada. bal balika shibirs make my summers. camera's were the best technological invention. eradicating facebook will cause many deaths. social network is a movie to watch. i can never decide on one thing. i have a tiny nose. but i have buck teeth. india trip 2003 was unexplainable. everytime i see Bapa, life takes a new turn. butterfly hair clips were cool. i wish i had taken gymnastics or iceskating classes. i love to swim. i can sometimes play the harmonium. olives are yummy. a hairtie on my wrist is a must, you never know when it's gonna get oily. i always carry unnecessary things especially all my colorful pens. i would rather be prepared for the obnoxious world out there than left with nothing. i have a permanent scar on my hand. my knees always crack when i sit. the winter holidays always warm my heart. i would hate being a toothfairy. money needs less value. every person is a unique snowflake, barcode, license plate, blade of grass, social security #. everyone has a unique identity and that's what makes this world a possible place to survive in. </p>
